## 🚀 Pull Requests

Here are some guidelines to make the process smoother:

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure your commits message means something
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

## 📝 Creating issues

### 🐛 Bug reports

Always try to provide as much information as possible:

- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected vs actual results
- Your environment (e.g. operating system, etc.) if relevant

### ✨ Feature requests

Lay out the reasoning behind it and propose an API for it. 
Ideally, you should have a practical example to prove the utility of the feature you're requesting.
